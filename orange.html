          <h6>Finally! Last page! It is 2 am in the morning and the dorm is burning up.</h6>
          <h3>The Anoying Orange</h3>
        <p>Sad story... I love this Orange. He could be found on Youtube. And they actually made a bunch of video games about it. I did not use his picture because I was not sure whether that was an violation of copyright. LOL.</p>
        <p>I look around my dorm and realized that I should have picked a different color, because brown and orange does not have much of a difference. </p>
        <p>But still, we could see orange at many places, such as...on an orange! It is a warm color. It is supposedly to bring warmth, which is the last thing I need right now. Why don't we have AC in our dorms:)</p>
          <h3 class="note">Rebecca Orange</h3>
          <p>As a series of Rebecca Purple, I googled Rebecca Orange as well. It turns out that this name belongs to a person, with Orange as his or her last name. Very healthy, indeed. </p>
        <p>Orange is the combination of red and yellow.</p>
